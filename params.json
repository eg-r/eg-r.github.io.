I have uploaded my MSc thesis as well as posters that I presented at national and international conferences.  \r\n\r\n#### Fringes and Centers of Academic life  \r\nMy [LinkedIn Profile](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/elika-garg-628a7744) contains a plethora of information related to my academic quests. It is certainly not all of it, but a lot, nonetheless.  \r\n\r\n#### World of Code-craft and -draft(s)  \r\nMy [GitHub Profile](@eg-r) says a little something about my programming experience. Learning R introduced me to the joys of programming, and I wish to continue learning coding skills.   \r\nHere is my first R-package, which was accepted by Bioconductor: [SIGHTS](https://github.com/eg-r/sights)  \r\n\r\n\r\n###### **Tidbits**  \r\n\r\n- I am actively looking for a full-time position, hoping to work more with R, but always open to learning new computer languages (I'd never know if I like it unless I try it!). Till now I have only properly worked with biological count data (gene expression from NanoString and High-Throughput Screening technologies).  \r\n\r\n- *This is my first webpage, thanks to awesome GitHub.*  \r\n",
