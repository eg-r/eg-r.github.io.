It is certainly not all of it, but a lot, nonetheless.  \r\n\r\n### **World of Code-craft and -draft(s)**  \r\nMy [GitHub Profile](@eg-r) says a little something about my programming experience. Learning R introduced me to the joys of programming, and I wish to continue learning coding skills.   \r\nHere is my first R-package, which was accepted by Bioconductor: [SIGHTS](https://github.com/eg-r/sights)  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n##### ***Tidbit***  \r\n\r\n- I am actively looking for a full-time position, hoping to work more with R, but always open to learning new computer languages (I'd never know if I like it unless I try it!). Till now I have only properly worked with biological count data (gene expression from NanoString and High-Throughput Screening technologies).  \r\n\r\n",
