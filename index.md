### **Academia and Publications**  
My [ResearchGate Profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elika_Garg) lists my published and/or presented work.  
My [MSc thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305699648_Examination_of_pre-processing_techniques_for_NanoString_nCounter_mRNA_data) brings together a collaborative [cancer study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269115973_Estrogen_receptor_alpha_drives_proliferation_in_PTEN-deficient_prostate_carcinoma_by_stimulating_survival_signaling_MYC_expression_and_altering_glucose_sensitivity) and my own statistical [methodology work](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305700049_Statistical_evaluation_of_normalization_methods_for_NanoString_nCounter_data) on NanoString nCounter mRNA data.  

### **Fringes and Centers of Academic life**  
My [LinkedIn Profile](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/elika-garg-628a7744) contains a plethora of information related to my academic quests. It is certainly not all of it, but a lot, nonetheless.  

### **World of Code-craft and -draft(s)**  
My [GitHub Profile](@eg-r) says a little something about my programming experience.  
Learning R introduced me to the joys of programming, and I wish to continue learning coding skills. Here is my first R-package, which was accepted by Bioconductor: [SIGHTS](https://github.com/eg-r/sights)

##### ***Tidbit***  

- I am actively looking for a full-time position, hoping to work more with R, but always open to learning new computer languages (I'd never know if I like it unless I try it!). Till now I have only properly worked with biological count data (gene expression from NanoString and High-Throughput Screening technologies).
